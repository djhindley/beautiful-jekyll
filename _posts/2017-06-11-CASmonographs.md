In 2015, the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) started publishing detailed monographs on specific topics.  
So far, there have been five such monographs:
1 – Stochastic Loss Reserving Using Bayesian MCMC Models, by Glenn Meyers, FCAS, MAAA, CERA
2 – Distributions for Actuaries, by David Bahnemann 
3 – Stochastic Loss Reserving Using Generalized Linear Models by Greg Taylor and Gráinne McGuire
4 – Using the ODP Bootstrap Model: A Practitioner’s Guide by Mark Shapland
5 – Generalized Linear Models for Insurance Rating by Mark Goldburd, Anand Khare, and Dan Tevet

Although these are likely to be widely known about amongst CAS members, they may be less well known to actuaries practising outside the U.S, but they are
a useful resource for actuaries worldwide.  Further details are available [here](http://www.casact.org/pubs/index.cfm?fa=monographs)
