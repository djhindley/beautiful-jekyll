With effect from 20 March 2017, the Ogden discount rate was set to -0.75%. A [consultation paper]({{site.baseurl}}\Ogdendiscountrateconsultationpaper_March17.pdf) was released by the Ministry of Justice in March 2017.

Following this, on 7 September 2017, a [consultation response]({{site.baseurl}}\discount-rate-response-consultation-print.pdf) was issued by the MoJ, along with details of the [draft legislation]({{site.baseurl}}\pdf\Ogdendiscountrateconsultationpaper_March17.pdf).

The Ogden tables themselves are produced by the Government Actuary's Department and are available [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ogden-tables-actuarial-compensation-tables-for-injury-and-death) in printed and Excel format.  This includes the supplementary tables to the 7th edition of the Ogden tables, that show multpliers using the rate of -0.75%, which was not used in previous versions of the tables.
