This post summarises the basic details of a reserving app that will accompany the forthcoming book on claims reserving in general insurance.  

1. The app can be accessed via this website - using the menu on the right-hand-side and clicking on Reserving Book/App or by clicking [here](http://www.davidjhindley.com:3838/Claimsreserving/). 
2. The app contains examples explained in the book for Chain Ladder, Mack, Bootstrap, Merz-Wuthrich, as well as a further example on the use of copula for aggregation of stochastic reserving results across multiple classes. 
3. No specialist software is required to run the app - just access to the internet via a web browser.
4. If you have comments or questions on the app, please use the discussion below or send an email to info@claimsreserving.com.
