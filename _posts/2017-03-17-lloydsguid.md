Certain market bodies or institutions issue reserving guidance or standards that apply to the relevant organisations. For example, Lloyd's of London produces minimum standards for reserving, which can be summarised as follows (as of the date of this post, anyway):

1. The board of the managing agent shall be responsible for setting reserves.
2. The managing agent shall ensure that a Statement of Actuarial Opinion (SAO) is obtained.
3. Managing agents shall ensure that an actuarial function is in place.
4. The managing agent shall ensure that sufficient information is supplied to the board on reserves..
5. The managing agent shall ensure they have a robust reserving procedure.
6. The managing agent shall have an appropriately documented reserving process.
7. The managing agent shall ensure that reserving data submissions to Lloyd's are appropriate.
