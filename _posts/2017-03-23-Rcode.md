R code will look like this:

```r
R code goes here
```

Of course, don't forget to document this function! Now users can try out an app showcasing your package by running `mypackage::runExample()`.

This method can easily support more than one Shiny app as well, simply place each app under `inst/shiny-examples/` and change the runExample code to something like this

```r
runExample <- function(example) {
  # locate all the shiny app examples that exist
  validExamples <- list.files(system.file("shiny-examples", package = "mypackage"))

  validExamplesMsg <-
    paste0(
      "Valid examples are: '",
      paste(validExamples, collapse = "', '"),
      "'")

  # if an invalid example is given, throw an error
  if (missing(example) || !nzchar(example) ||
      !example %in% validExamples) {
    stop(
      'Please run `runExample()` with a valid example app as an argument.\n',
      validExamplesMsg,
      call. = FALSE)
  }

  # find and launch the app
  appDir <- system.file("shiny-examples", example, package = "mypackage")
  shiny::runApp(appDir, display.mode = "normal")
}
```

Now running `runExample("myapp")` will launch the "myapp" app, and running `runExample()` will generate a message telling the user what examples are allowed.
