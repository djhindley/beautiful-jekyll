A web-based app is available that is designed to accompany the forthcoming book on claims reserving in general insurance, described here.  

1. The app can be accessed [here](https://www.davidjhindley.com/shiny/claimsreserving).  Copy this link if you wish to access the app directly from your browser in future.  
2. The app contains examples explained in the book for Chain Ladder, Mack, Bootstrap, Merz-Wuthrich, as well as a further example on the use of copula for aggregation of stochastic reserving results across multiple classes. 
3. No specialist software is required to run the app - just access to the internet via a web browser.
4. If you have comments or questions on the app, send an email to info@claimsreserving.com or contribute to the discussion [here]({% post_url 2017-03-23-reserving-app %}).
